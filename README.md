# lab3 test v1.0.2?

> got the program to detect dupe items
>> used a hash map to determine if the user add the same item.
>> added an currentAmount object in main. sorta acts like the currentProduct object.

>slighty modified Amount.java
>> changed addProducts() so that it returns the amount.

> fixed the total amount so that it only display up to 2 dec places
> deleted all of the if statements since the prof is only gonna use normal names for the file.
> changed some variable names for clarity

TODO:
Task 5 from the prompt:
When the user enters enough payment, the program terminates by printing the contents of the receipt text file it stored in your Repl.it project folder.

Fix the format of the receipt.txt

Be sure to add javadoc to cart.java, amount.java, and product.java

if we have time, clean up the code?
